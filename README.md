# concrete5 ideas

The goal of this document is to gather ideas of how
concrete5 can improve its communication via different channels.
Many of these ideas cannot be executed by its authors. This document
however can be taken as a resource for the concrete5 team when things
are to be changed. The list is gathered by active concrete5 community members
who want to express their ideas, suggestions, and wishes.
